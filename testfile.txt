GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. 
It provides a space for developers to store their code online, collaborate with others, and manage their projects. 
GitHub offers tools for version control, code review, and issue tracking




A Git staging environment is where changes are reviewed before being committed to the repository. 
It acts as an intermediate area to verify and test code updates. 
This helps catch and fix issues before they are merged into the main project, ensuring stability and quality.
